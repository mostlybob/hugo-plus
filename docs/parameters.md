# Shortcodes
Shortcodes are self-contained and cannot access parameters of the site or page.
For documentation for each shortcode, you'll have to view the shortcode's source
	In the future, it'd be nice to move documentation and default configuration
		of shortcodes into the `data/shortcode/<plugin>/<shortcode>.toml` or something
